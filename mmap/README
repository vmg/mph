This directory contains a Keys interface that uses the mmap(2) system call
to map the contents of the key file into mph's address space, instead of
reading the entire file into memory. This reduces the memory consumption of
mph. It may also reduce the execution time of mph, but probably not by much.

Another minor benefit of this Keys interface is that it doesn't impose an
upper limit on the maximum length of a key.

This modified version is (probably) only useful if you have an enormous
key file and you don't want mph to be a memory hog. However, note that
the memory requirements for the Graph object might still dominate any
savings you gain from using the new Keys interface (see section "MEMORY
REQUIREMENTS" in mph.doc for more information on the memory requirements
of mph).

The version of mph.c in this directory has been slightly modified from the
original to handle the new Keys interface.

This version of mph takes as an additional argument the name of the key file -
you can't pipe it to mph anymore, since mmap(2) doesn't seem to work on pipes.

To build this version of mph, copy the files Makefile, graph.c, graph.h,
misc.c, misc.h, arena.c and arena.h from the previous directory into the
current directory and then type

	% CCFLAGS=... LDFLAGS=... make mph

for appropriate CCFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
