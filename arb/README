This directory contains an alternative implementation of mph that
allows an arbitrary hash value assignment to each key (e.g. if the
keys are stored in main memory, it is possible to generate a hash
function that, for each key, computes its exact address in memory).
In fact, the arbitrary hash value assignment need not be a bijection
(see subdirectory "example" for an example of this).

The Keys and Graph interfaces and emitc have also been modified to
support this version of mph.

To build the alternative versions of mph and emitc, copy the files
Makefile, misc.c, misc.h, arena.c and arena.h from the previous
directory into the current directory and then type

	% CCFLAGS=... LDFLAGS=... make

for appropriate CCFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

See subdirectory "example" for a sample hash function generated by
this version of mph.
