This directory contains a sample hash function generated by
the alternative "arbitrary hash value" mph implementation in
the previous directory.

To test it, copy the file tst.c from directory ../../example
into the current directory and then type

	% make
	% sed 's/=[^=]*$//' <dow.in | ./dow

The sed command removes the '=value' portion from each
'key=value' line.
