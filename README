This is version 1.2 of mph, an order preserving minimal perfect hash
function generator for string keys. It uses the algorithm presented
in the paper:

        A Family of Perfect Hashing Methods
        B. S. Majewski, N. C. Wormald, G. Havas and Z. J. Czech
        Computer Journal (to appear).

The algorithm is probabilistic and runs fast in practice.
